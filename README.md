Title: ???

Description: 
  We are attempting to build/create a better music suffling algorithm, potentially if we have time at the end of the semester we would combine this with spotify and spotify features. Among these general improvements we want to make the shuffle more customizable by many or any topic you can rank music through. The main customizable feature would be to use some kind of ranking system to impact the shuffle.

Vision Statement:

Motivation:
  Our motivation is disatisfaction with some current shuffle algorithms and a desire to have more control over a music shuffle
  
Risks: 
  1. We have to learn new languages like html
  2. The randomization element could provide alot of difficulty to the program working as we desire
  3. Combining our design with spotify could provide difficulty

Mitigation Strategy:
  1. The entire group works on learning and mastering html
  2. Do research into current randomization algorithms to provide a solid base to build from
  3. Doing reasearch into the spotify API
  
6 User Stories: (unique ID # per story, agile format, size)

6 user stories
Each story must have a unique ID number
Written in the Agile format: “As a [role], I want to [do X] so that I can [benefit with Y]”
Each requirement must have a size. You have two options for sizing: 
    Agile sizing – story points
    Time estimate to complete
All stories should be sized to be completed in less than 8 hours (approximately, and something equivalent to a day or less in Agile story points). If your story is bigger than that, then break it up into smaller stories.

Project Tracking software:
  We plan to use Trello as our tracking software and regular uploads to the github repository
